                        Project Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am makeing a spaceship radar simulator.
The radar system will help the spaceship avoid collission. The objects that 
could cause collissions include: other spaceships, satellites, space debris, 
and asteroids. The radar system wil scan its sorroudings for objects, if an 
object is encountered near its path, it gets the size and velocity of the
object and then finds the distance of object and probability of impact. If there
is a high probability of impact, it calculates the nearest safe path to travel. 
The user interface wil be inform of a radar display that shows the objects in 
accordance with their size to scale near the spaceship. it also displays
number of objects within the spaceships's sorroundings. When an object
is clicked it shows the objects distance and probability of impact. Users could
also move the objects by dragging them across the map. There will also be 
an option to zoom in and out of the map. It will also have a scanner that 
simulates the rotating scanner. it will also have a fastforward and rewind
option to change speed of the simulator. Up, down, left, and right button to 
move the map. Finally it will have a start, stop, find new path, reset button
and an alarm button if collission cannot be avoided/ potential impact.

                        Correctly Implemented
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have implemented everything correctly to the best of my knowledge

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        Architecture
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Main class depends on MyFrame class to create the window frame

MyFrame class depends on MyPanel class to create layout of the window frame.
It also relies on JFrame to create the window frame.

MyPanel relies on:
    DrawingCanvas class to draw the shapes as instructed by client
    MyButton class to create buttons for the panel
    JPanel to create a panel to store elements

How to compile: 
---------------
1. run javac *.java
2. run java Main

                        Project Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am makeing a spaceship radar simulator.
The radar system will help the spaceship avoid collission. The objects that 
could cause collissions include: other spaceships, satellites, space debris, 
and asteroids. The radar system wil scan its sorroudings for objects, if an 
object is encountered near its path, it gets the size and velocity of the
object and then finds the distance of object and probability of impact. If there
is a high probability of impact, it calculates the nearest safe path to travel. 
The user interface wil be inform of a radar display that shows the objects in 
accordance with their size to scale near the spaceship. it also displays
number of objects within the spaceships's sorroundings. When an object
is clicked it shows the objects distance and probability of impact. Users could
also move the objects by dragging them across the map. There will also be 
an option to zoom in and out of the map. It will also have a scanner that 
simulates the rotating scanner. it will also have a fastforward and rewind
option to change speed of the simulator. Up, down, left, and right button to 
move the map. Finally it will have a start, stop, find new path, reset button
and an alarm button if collission cannot be avoided/ potential impact.

                      What program does so far
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have correctly implemented panels for drawing on my window. The Panels are
able to resize with their drawings but there is a limit for minimzation
to ensure every item remains visible. Maximization has no limit.

I have also implemented the Start and end button. The start button starts the
simulation while the end button ends the simulation. 
The other buttons just show text when clicked. They have not yet been 
implemented.

I have added some drawings representing the objects I am going to have.
There is a rectangle drawing which will be use to showcase object information
There is a huge circle drawing representing the map, with the circumference
of the circle representing the scope.

The map has a pointer that rotates around it to simulate a radar's sweep hand.
The radar will start sweeping when start is clicked and stop when end is 
clicked.

The map also has drawings of a spaceship, planet, and asteroid. The position
of these objects update after a period of time. The positions are limited to 
inside the map.

The program correctly quits when the window is closed.

                    Potential bug?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have this error on my IDE but all files compile well and program runs

The error is : The type DrawingCanvas cannot be a superinterface of 
            ObjectBoxCanvas; a superinterface must be an interface
same error shows in MyMap file for the classes implementing the DrawingCanvas
interface.

The IDE I am using is: Vscode

                        Architecture
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program is implemented using Java.swing interface

Main class creates the window frame by relying on JFrame

Main calls the MyPanel class to create layout of the window frame. It relies
JPanel

MyPanel relies on:
    JPanel to create the windows
    MyMap to draw the map of one of the panels
    ObjectInformation to  draw the rectangle to display object information
    MyButton class to implement the button in the panels

MyMap relies on:
    Jpanel to create panels for drawing
    DrawingCanvas to create drawings

DrawingCanvas is a public interface used by both MyMap and ObjectInformation

MyButton relies on JButton

How to run: 
---------------
1. run javac *.java
2. run java Main
3. Click start button, bottom of window to begin simulation
